Software Updater for apt
------------------------

This is an application which lets you manage available updates for your
computer via apt and python-apt.

It also supports easy release upgrades.  The following environment variables
are honored:

DEBUG_UPDATE_MANAGER:
- If set, debug information is printed to sys.stderr.  This is useful for
  testing e.g. release upgrade checking/fetching.


If the release upgrade is running in text mode and gnu screen is
available it will automatically use gnu screen. This means that if
e.g. the network connection is dropping just running the upgrader
again will just reconnect to the running upgrade.
